		<p>We not only inherently design proteins and enzymes through evolution we also inherit behavior and goals. The biological reinforcements within the cerebral cortex. Once we have a working model of an agent that operates as an interplay between a reward function, the Using game theory to rationalize and forcefully control interaction between agents and letting them evolve with constraints can help us identify language goals.</p>

				<p>In computer science and the broader field of science, an algorithm is typically defined as a step-by-step procedure or a set of well-defined instructions for performing a specific task or solving a particular problem. It is a finite sequence of unambiguous, executable instructions that, when followed, leads to the solution of a problem or the completion of a task.</p>

		<p>Diagonalization is a technique often used in mathematical proofs, including the proof of the halting problem. In the context of the halting problem, diagonalization is applied to show that a supposed list or enumeration of all possible algorithms cannot exist.The idea is to assume the existence of such a list and then construct a new algorithm that contradicts it</p>

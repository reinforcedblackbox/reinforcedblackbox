In a system like the human brain where it uses a multi-stimulus context verification for verification of simple menial tasks like, let's say, driving, where the context-based verification can be used for every action. Every action, because driving in itself is a very menial task for the human brain, and so you can use multiple contextual stimuli to compare your actions and make decisions in a self-aware, self-verification sense of self, sort of core belief and core understanding that helps us solve this problem of self-verification.

This can be explained very clearly using an example like object classification where let's say you are classifying animal objects and you have two streams of stimuli in two different sensory modalities that are processed in separate areas of the brain or in separate networks within that are trained using an individual piece of data a separate piece of data and you so the image is so blurred and and so vague that and obscure that you can only get let's say an elephant passes by or and the image is like a transitionary image and you you can classify that it's an elephant with 10% accuracy and another scenario and and also we have another similar let's say it's sound and you have the sound of an elephant but then even that is not clear but then it gives you like a 30% accuracy with this sort of self-verification and self-validation methods you can combine these values individual network outputs and then create a new self-verified knowledge piece of knowledge that conforms and increases the self-validated value and accuracy of the action to to be classified to probably 90s and 100 percentage and which is what this sort of self-validation and self-verification of knowledge in AI comes in.
